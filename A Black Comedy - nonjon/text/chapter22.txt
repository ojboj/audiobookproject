 Author's Note: I'd like to claim that the delay on this chapter was abnormal and I'm about to jump right into a more regular writing and posting schedule, but I can't. Sorry. Feel free to do what I do and just blame my mom. (Not to mention she's ruined the punchline for one of my old favorite jokes. Q: What do you give the woman who has everything? A: Cancer. I know it's doubly tasteless now that it's true, but that's still funny.) 
 Nevertheless, I doubt the next chapter or two will take anywhere near as long as this one. Feel free to PM me and nudge me to hurry up on the next chapter, as those things more often inspire me to hurry than discourage me. Just realize that writing and posting this fic is a lower priority than usual for the near future. Big thanks to the usual folks who help me with this story: IP, Chuck, Jim, Sean, Rob, and others I'm forgetting. All comments, reviews, and feedback are appreciated. 
  CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO 
Harry appeared with a pop just off the path leading to Hogwarts.
He began the slow trudge up to the castle, all the while reminding himself the man he was meeting was not the Headmaster he knew, nor was he an enemy.
Harry saw light coming from Hagrid's cabin and thought back to his many happy memories of time spent in a world similar to this one. The Whomping Willow was swaying in the night breeze.
Harry looked around him and saw no one in sight. He picked up a rock off the path and threw it straight towards the dangerous tree. The willow eagerly swatted the rock right back to Harry.
Recognizing the tree seemed in a playful mood, Harry picked up half a dozen more rocks with his invisible, magical appendages and proceeded to throw them all towards the tree. He easily kept up with the magical old willow catching all the rocks and throwing them right back as if the two of them were playing several simultaneous games of catch.
"Lord Black?" Albus cautiously asked as he walked up behind Harry.
Harry's arms caught all of the rocks headed his way and held onto them this time as he turned and greeted, "Headmaster."
The Whomping Willow let out a whistling sigh and appeared to deflate upon the realization that its fun had come to an end.
Albus smiled at Harry. "I can honestly say I've never seen the Whomping Willow used quite like that."
Harry launched a rock one last time towards the tree, admitting, "First time for me too."
The tree was fully capable of nursing a grudge and swung a thick branch right at the final rock, sending it flying up to the castle. There was a loud crack when the stone smacked against the window of the Headmaster's office and bounced helplessly off the magically reinforced glass.
Albus looked at the tree and his office's tower. "I think she's upset I interrupted you."
"She?" Harry asked. "The Whomping Willow is female?"
"Does she seem like a 'he' to you?"
Harry shook his head. "No, I suppose not."
"I did not expect to see you so soon," Albus admitted, inspecting Harry. "Am I only to be graced by one Lord Black this evening?"
"Just me," Harry answered and turned towards the castle. "Have you got time for a conversation?"
"For one as enlightening as this one promises to be," Albus waved Harry forward and began walking in step with him. "I will happily clear my schedule."
"You're enjoying this entirely too much," Harry admitted with a smile as he walked next to Albus.
"Shall I invite certain guests to join us?" Albus inquired. "Perhaps some others for whom-"
"No," Harry interrupted. "In fact, I was thinking we might both benefit from a charm of brotherhood."
Albus showed only slight surprise at the suggestion. The most common charm of brotherhood entwined two people to the point that they would know when their 'brother' was lying to them, telling them the truth, or hiding something. It additionally would protect one brother's secrets based on the will of that brother. So if Albus' desire to tell someone a secret of Harry's was not stronger than Harry's desire for Albus not to tell, then Albus would be unable to. "Do you really think that's necessary?"
"Necessary? No," Harry replied. "But I'm here offering to be as honest with you as you are with me. I'm also going to ask that you not tell any of your alternate sounding boards," Harry gave Albus an accusing look, "any of your theories about me or Sirius."
Albus had the decency to look bashful before replying, "Do you really think that's fair?"
"Extremely fair," Harry eagerly answered.
"Harry," Albus chided.
"Albus," Harry retorted as they arrived at the Headmaster's office. "It's fair because I'm limiting your freedom to discuss it with others, and in turn willingly discussing it with you myself. It's a charm of brotherhood. It's built for fairness."
Albus circled around to sit behind his desk. "I meant fair to others. People like the Potters for what they don't know, or the Lupins for what they do."
Harry plopped down into a comfortable chair. He knew Albus wanted him as an ally and couldn't resist the thirst for knowledge. "This charm, and this conversation, is for you and me. Not them."
Albus sat there silently for a minute before nodding. "I can accept that. Tea?" He swished his wand and conjured a complete steaming set.
"Tea second," Harry said casting a spell over his right hand making it glow. He stuck it out towards Albus. "Charm first."
Albus set down the teapot and cast the same charm of brotherhood over his hand. "Very well." He shook Harry's hand sealing the spell as both their hands faded to normal. "How do you take it?"
"One sugar please," Harry replied and accepted the cup of tea.
Albus took a sip from his cup and sat back. He set the cup down and smiled happily.
Harry saw how pleased Albus looked and resisted the urge to groan. "You know you're smiling more than Sirius does when his one night stand leaves in the morning."
Albus just grinned and sought confirmation. "Your godfather, Sirius?"
Harry set his cup onto Albus' desk. "You're just dying to jump right into things, aren't you?"
"I make no secret of my desire for understanding."
"A rather annoying old man once told me the truth is a beautiful and terrible thing," Harry quipped. "And that it should be treated with great caution."
"Who said that?"
"You did," Harry succinctly replied. "Well, not exactly you."
Albus nodded, having suspected as much. "You have me at a disadvantage."
"Said the blackmailer," Harry retorted.
Albus frowned but saw little point in quibbling over words.
"Just ask what you want to, Albus," Harry helplessly admitted.
"What have I done to give you such a low opinion of me?" Albus questioned. He added with a smile, "Or not exactly me."
Harry bit the inside of his cheek. "Can we start with something simpler?"
"Very well," Albus agreed. "How about this one: tell me Harry Potter, why are you so opposed to your family, to your parents, knowing just who you are?"
Harry winced. "Because I don't know them. And there's already enough drama in my life."
"But you do know the Lupins?"
Harry sighed and figured he should start from the beginning. "Alright, first off, I suppose you need a little alternate history lesson. Halloween 1981, in the reality I grew up in, the Dark Lord Voldemort attacked at Godric's Hollow."
Albus nodded, urging Harry to go on.
"My parents were home that night," Harry explained. "And that night they died protecting me. So I've never known any James or Lily Potter. Sirius, my godfather, came through the Exit-"
"The Exit?"
Harry nodded. "The Exit, the veil, the death chamber, the stone archway in the Department of Mysteries, whatever you want to call it, my godfather fell through it over ten years ago. I began researching it in February. A by-product of my work was Sirius fell out the other side and into this world just a few months ago. So when he woke up in a hospital bed, he asked for Remus Lupin, his best friend in our reality. Hence, Tonks and Remus knew about me and my history before I ever arrived in this world."
Albus was tempted to inquire about the specifics of crossing over but wanted to understand Harry better. "That does not explain why you have not told your parents."
"James and Lily Potter seem like nice people," Harry admitted. "But they're not my parents."
"Not exactly," Albus replied using Harry's own words.
"Sirius was going to tell James who he was," Harry explained. "But when they met Sirius realized just how different this James Potter was from my dad."
"Those two do seem to rub each other the wrong way, don't they?"
Harry shrugged. "I can see it from both sides."
"And yet you choose to continue to deceive your 'not quite' parents."
Harry gave Albus a significant look. "It's only dumb luck that in this world there is a middle-aged couple who dealt with the grief of losing a baby and raised two other kids. My parents never saw twenty-two. You really think getting to know the Potters will tell me anything about my parents? They never even met them."
"Then perhaps you could give a middle-aged couple who dealt with the grief of losing a baby some peace of mind to know in other worlds their son has lived a healthy, happy life?"
Harry laughed. "You're really something else."
"I shall take that as a compliment."
Harry took another sip of his tea. "I know you want to stay on our good side. All I ask is that you let us tell the Potters in our own time."
Albus took a moment to observe Harry. "I can agree to that as long as you keep me informed of the people you do share the knowledge of your unique origins with."
"Albus," Harry sighed tiredly and glanced over at Fawkes empty perch. "I am not your student, nor an Order member. Those I and Sirius confide in are our business, not yours."
"I understand," Albus backtracked. "I just think it's in both of our best interests to keep this to ourselves for now."
Harry looked at Albus speculatively. "I would have thought you'd be a lot more vocal in championing an awkward reunion of sorts."
"The fewer people aware that there is a new candidate for the prophecy, the better."
Realization crossed Harry's face and he shook his head. "Sorry, Albus. But that prophecy isn't about me."
"You defeated the Voldemort of your world, didn't you?"
"What makes you think that?"
Albus smiled. "You dueled him. And you were entirely too confident and comfortable. Sirius hid it pretty well, but his eyes showed worry and fear. Your only fear was for Sirius."
"Yes," Harry admitted with a mixture of pain and pride. "I did defeat my Voldemort. But I can't vanquish this one any more than you can."
Albus frowned at the truthfulness he sensed. "Are you certain?"
"I have some idea of the costs you paid to defeat your Dark Lord," Harry instructed. "And in case you missed it, Voldemort is not a dark wizard. He's a genuine Dark Lord and all that that implies."
Albus winced as though the confirmation hurt him. "I had hoped that wasn't the case."
Harry grinned helplessly. "The muggles have a saying about putting all your hopes in one hand and then sh-"
"I'm familiar with the saying," Albus interrupted. "Thank you, Harry."
"Just trying to help."
Albus frowned in thought. "Was the cost to you simply too high to pay again?"
Harry considered the question before answering. "Yeah… I don't know. I'm not sure to be honest. But fortunately for me, it's not possible to pay again so I don't have to think about it."
"What was your cost?"
Harry was surprised Albus was asking so boldly. He let no emotion show as he watched the old man.
Albus nodded in understanding and voluntarily admitted, "I sacrificed the ability to father children and then I lost the ability to fall in love."
Harry hadn't known the specifics but guessed it had been something close to that for Albus. He knew how high that cost would be to a wizard like Albus. With a lick of his lips, Harry softly admitted, "I sacrificed my mother's everlasting soul."
Albus blinked in shock. "And what did you lose?"
Harry slowly shook his head. "My sacrifice was deemed sufficient."
Albus couldn't even imagine what Harry felt. The word came out as a whisper. "How?"
"When I was a baby she gave her life to protect me from Voldemort. It meant his next Killing Curse marked my noggin and bounced back into his face. It also left me with a protection from him." Harry frowned adding, "until he overcame that too."
Albus nodded in comprehension. "And since you carried her protection…"
"I was able to offer a soul other than my own," Harry finished for him. He sighed tiredly. "The worst part is that whenever I'm near the Lily Potter around here, the old magic wakes up and pulls on her soul. I'm like a harmless but annoying personal dementor to her."
"She mentioned feeling a draw to you," Albus agreed. "I assumed it was a mother's intuition not a… soul-sucking vortex."
"Don't just think like a wizard. Any muggle will tell you it's always a soul-sucking vortex."
Albus saw the forced smile as Harry tried to joke about his sacrifice. He could tell this was not a burden Harry had dealt with as much as one the young man had simply ignored. He immediately concluded that Lily Potter would be a tremendous help to Harry.
"Stop scheming," Harry grumbled. "I feel you plotting against me."
"Sorry," Albus reflexively replied, well aware Harry would sense he wasn't sorry in the slightest. "I don't suppose you have a second mother's sacrificial protection and the willingness to barter their soul?"
Harry shook his head. "Just the one. But I do have a rather pesky ghost haunting me."
Albus hadn't expected such a serious response. "Do you think he…?"
"Nope," Harry snapped. "I tried her first. Didn't work. She's kind of sensitive about it now."
"I would imagine so."
Harry smiled wanly. "Unfortunately, it furthered her delusion that we're destined to be together forever."
"I know a tribal chief skilled in matters of necromancy and souls," Albus offered.
"Believe me I've thought it about, often," Harry assured him. "But she usually behaves. And she was a good friend long before she became an ex."
"You're haunted by an ex-girlfriend?" Albus clarified smothering his own amusement. "Say the word. I can send a letter to my friend."
"Nah," Harry shook his head thinking how he actually needed Ginny's ghostly expertise. "She's a nuisance, but it's nice to have someone else who remembers our old world."
Albus grinned as he felt the charm of brotherhood's nudge indicating that Harry was hiding something. "Old world? Does that mean you are here to stay?"
"Yeah, that's the plan. The Exit to our old world was destroyed after I got pulled in. Wouldn't know how to get back even if it was still intact."
"Not expecting any visitors? And no travelers beyond yourself and Sirius?"
"The one I studied was used for executions a century ago but it had been misaligned. When I corrected it, Sirius was the only one spit out in this world, from what I'm told."
Albus nodded. "I believe it was 1903 when the dementor's kiss replaced execution as the highest form of punishment in our courts."
"Sounds about right."
Albus took another sip of his tea, thinking over all he'd learned so far. "Do you think perhaps it is your hope that the prophecy doesn't refer to you that's influencing your interpretation?"
"I'm not some wayward child, Albus," Harry retorted as he sat up a bit prouder. "I didn't just get a lucky shot in a duel. It was several years after your death that I finally defeated the bastard. And I don't appreciate feeling like a pawn in the game you're playing."
Albus raised his hands in deference. "I am sorry if my conversation feels like manipulation to you. But it sounds like my counterpart may have wronged you and that is coloring your perceptions. To use your metaphor, I am not the chess master, but just another piece in the same game you are."
"I want no part of that game."
"I wish it were that simple," Albus admitted. "And while you may not be the king I'd hoped, you are still a knight, the same as me. Maybe you've not moved from your spot and maybe you won't have to, but I assure you, you are most definitely on the board."
Harry frowned. "I think you've driven the metaphor into the ground."
"I thought I might have," Albus admitted reaching for the candy dish on his desk. He pondered whether he even wanted to know. "Can I ask you a question?"
"Obviously, you've just done so," Harry said with a smirk.
Albus grinned. "I've used that line on you, haven't I?"
Harry gave an affirmative nod and urged Albus to continue.
"Would it be beneficial for me to inquire about the details of my counterpart's demise?"
Harry saw Albus was leaving the decision up to him. "It is not a situation that will repeat itself here, but it might help you to understand our relationship a bit better."
Albus sensed Harry was more affected than he was showing. "You were there, weren't you?"
Harry nodded. "Alright, first off, in my totally objective and unbiased opinion you should realize Severus Snape of my old world is a bigger asshole than you'd find on a blind giant's narcoleptic bride."
Albus looked vaguely unsettled as he processed the meaning. "Severus?"
"Yeah," Harry admitted before pausing. "I'm not sure the details of this world's Snape, but in my old one he joined the Death Eaters right out of school. There was probably some reason like the executive washroom for inner circle members had too much gold trim for his delicate sense of aesthetics. Whatever it was, he quickly turned traitor, secretly stabbing his new friends in the back, and became the Order's spy in the Dark Lord's organization."
Albus was fighting a smile. "You could just say you weren't aware of Severus' motives."
"You weren't exactly forthcoming with that information any more than Snape was," Harry retorted. "As a result, you were the only person who trusted him. Probably on either side, come to think of it."
"This is leading somewhere, isn't it," Albus encouraged. "You're not just insulting my Potions professor?"
"Contrary to what you imply, merely insulting your Potions professor is in fact an excellent and worthwhile way to pass the time," Harry argued. "But yes, I'm getting there."
Albus muttered to himself, "Maybe it's a Potter thing."
"How do you think Snape would respond if all the Potters were dead except for a baby, especially one hailed as the savior and hero of the wizarding world while still in diapers?"
Albus briefly wondered if Severus would be able to set aside his bitterness. He stifled a snort. "Understood."
"Anyways, I'm just trying to explain the fact that my entire fifth year at Hogwarts you avoided me, until the end of the year when Sirius died—or what passed for dead at the time—and you only then informed me of the prophecy."
Albus frowned uncertainly.
"I say this so you understand that in sixth year, when you'd finally started to become something of a mentor to me, it was a pretty shitty thing you did."
"And what did I do?"
"You petrified me and covered me with an invisibility cloak as Death Eaters stormed the Astronomy Tower. Then you allowed yourself to get captured and let or more likely invited Severus to strike you down with a Killing Curse, sending you to your death and a grisly fall."
Albus sat there silently allowing Harry to speak.
"I couldn't move until you were dead," Harry weakly relayed. "I know Severus Snape could never really take you, but I guess you wanted to give him iron-clad proof of his loyalty to the Dark Lord. I think you had to have been sick and dying anyway, but I couldn't even get confirmation of that."
Albus steepled his fingers in thought, "You will have a better idea of my counterpart's motivation but I am sorry you had to see that."
"That's when things really started to go to hell in a hand basket too. With you dead, people lost hope and just wanted to give up. The second war got really bad after that."
Albus was saddened but could identify with the burden his counterpart had carried. "Were we close?"
"Kind of, yeah," Harry paused thinking neither yes nor no sounded right. "I think we should've been closer and I don't doubt that you loved me like a grandson, but you messed up a lot where I'm concerned."
"Enlighten me," Albus cheerfully instructed. "So that I may avoid making the same mistakes."
Harry stopped himself from saying, 'just don't force me back to the Dursleys.' He took a sip of his tea and looked up at the eager Headmaster. "Don't worry. You can't make those particular mistakes again. I just had the one childhood to ruin and fragile emotional psyche to shatter. And besides, we've talked about my old world plenty. For all intents and purposes, that world was a long waking dream for me. Let's talk about this one."
"The experiences of our pasts define who we are today," Albus intoned. "But we can talk about this world. Would you like to join the Order?"
Harry fought a smile. "That was abrupt."
Albus nodded. "I suspect you will not accept my invitation at first, so I thought I should begin laying the groundwork for future overtures."
"Blunt honesty too," Harry grinned. "I'll give you points for effort."
Albus looked at Harry hopefully but nodded when the younger man made his denial clear. "Luckily for him but perhaps unfortunately for the Order, Severus Snape has never been a Death Eater in this world."
Harry gave a look of mischief. "Are you sure? Would you bet your life on that?"
"I trust Severus Snape," Albus said. "But alas, there are grains of truth in some of the stories surrounding his ill-fated attempt to join the Dark Lord."
"If I promise not to enjoy them too much, could you tell me the real ones?"
Albus scrutinized Harry. "I sincerely doubt you could make that promise."
"True," Harry agreed before forcing a twinkle into his eye. "Pretty please?"
"I hope that look you made rarely worked on me."
"Never tried it on you," Harry said. "But it never worked on Hermione."
"Hermione Granger?" Albus asked and received an affirmative response. "Is that why you abducted her and took her to Africa?"
"Just having a spot of fun," Harry replied. "And I'm quite sure my best friend Hermione would agree that this Hermione needed a kick in the pants and a poke in the-"
"Harry," Albus warned.
"…eye," Harry innocently finished. "Weren't you about to tell me about Snape's ill-fated attempt?"
Albus took his time but obliged. "Severus had been denied back when he was student. But he had an acquaintance prepared to vouch for him. I called in a few favors and secured him a Ministry exemption for all non-harmful dark arts."
"Non-harmful?"
Albus nodded. "Severus' potion making skills were never in question, but it was required that he demonstrate some other coveted talents. He led his initiation evaluators-"
"Wait," Harry interrupted. "Initiation evaluators?"
"They may have been having a laugh at Severus' expense, but yes, they referred to themselves as initiation evaluators. As I was saying, Severus led them to a muggle woman that he specifically targeted."
Harry grinned. "Yeah?"
Albus took a breath and reluctantly explained. "He intended to sow chaos and discord among countless muggles worldwide."
"He didn't attack the Queen, did he?"
Albus shook his head quickly. "That rumor is patently false. No, the woman is simply an author, just an extremely popular one. His plan was to 'torture' muggles with a poorly written story."
Harry goggled. "That was his grand plan?"
Albus winced. "Had I known his intentions beforehand I would have advised him against that course of action. But he had decided I would be better off ignorant of the details of his less than legal activities."
"I take it the initiation evaluators were unimpressed?"
Albus took off his glasses to rub the bridge of his nose. "More amused than anything else. He misinterpreted their laughter and cheers and made a few boisterous comments that have since taken on a life of their own."
"Like what?"
"I believe the Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes offer a shirt exclaiming, 'We will get them where we can hurt them the most. We will attack … at their leisure.'"
"At their leisure?" Harry snickered.
"There may have been some strutting and billowing of his cloak when he said it."
Harry smiled at the image before frowning in consternation. "Does that mean you have no ears within the Dark Lord's ranks?"
Albus schooled his face showing no emotion. "It shouldn't surprise you that I won't be answering that question."
"Good point," Harry admitted. "So what can you tell me about That Fucker?"
Albus was momentarily shocked. "Excuse me?"
"Are you That Fucker?" Harry asked while openly inspecting Albus.
"I assume you are referring to the mysterious wizard in black who occupies much of Voldemort's time?"
"Damn," Harry swore, knowing it was an unlikely possibility. "That would have almost made sense."
Albus could tell Harry had concluded that he wasn't the mysterious wizard. "What do you know of the wizard that led you to suspect me?"
"Not much," Harry admitted. "Just that it's someone strong enough and willing to stand up to the Dark Lord."
"I will admit that is a woefully short list."
"And," Harry interrupted. "And I know this mysterious wizard didn't show up until after the disappearance of Neville Longbottom. Perhaps someone who knows the two first candidates were dead and he needed to wait for another son born at the end of a July. Someone with a little too much faith in the prophecy, believing he cannot vanquish the Dark Lord. So he does all he can to thwart Voldemort without actively engaging him."
"You've thought this through," Albus replied slightly surprised he was a suspect.
Harry shrugged. "I would imagine that sometimes you… 'limit your arsenal' let's say. Because you are so widely perceived to be and looked upon as the consummate light wizard and role model."
"You think I could hide behind a mask and be a bit more ruthless?"
Harry snorted. "Do you really want me to answer that?"
Albus frowned playfully. "No, I think you've answered it quite clearly."
Harry scratched his head. "In retrospect, it does sound a bit nutty. Even for you."
"I'd like to think so," Albus agreed. "I should point out one fallacy of your logic is that the idea of waiting on a new subject for the prophecy is one that's widely shared by others. There are many people out there who actively avoid having children near the end of July for that very reason."
"Makes sense."
"Yes, well there are also those that induce birth just before midnight and the calendar turns to August, almost always leading to complications."
"You're kidding."
Albus shook his head. "I'm afraid not. It appears that night is as cursed as the Defense Against the Dark Arts position. Speaking of, have you ever considered teaching?"
Harry looked at Albus incredulously. "Bite me."
Albus chuckled. "A 'no' would have been sufficient."
"But not as effective," Harry assured him. "I take it you're not one of those keeping their eyes on the maternity ward around the end of July?"
Albus sighed and sat back tiredly in his chair. "For many years, I had been holding on to the hope that Neville Longbottom is still out there."
Harry noticed the use of 'had' rather than 'have.' "You don't believe that anymore?"
Albus looked at Harry innocently. "Not for the last couple of days, no."
Harry was quick to anger. "You still think its-"
"Please, Harry," Albus stopped him. "I firmly understand that you do not believe the prophecy applies to you. I may have reservations but I do not doubt that you have none. I'm not trying to pester you. I'm merely admitting that until a couple days ago, I had never questioned whether Neville was still out there somewhere. I had to believe he was. Your appearance gives me doubt."
"It's not me," Harry childishly pouted.
"Do keep in mind that until this conversation I was unaware that you already had defeated a Dark Lord and that Voldemort legitimately was one," Albus pointed out. "I don't think the prophecy refers to you, but I'm not certain. And you definitely… shake things up a bit."
"So you haven't squirreled Neville away for some special secret training?" Harry asked and saw the look on Albus' face. "Didn't think so. And you don't think Neville is That Fucker?"
Albus looked at Harry curiously. "I assume from your preoccupation that your world had no such unknown wizard in black."
"Nope. My world was quite a bit different from this one," Harry admitted with a shrug. "Hell, probably the second most dangerous person and right hand to the Dark Lord was Bellatrix."
"Really?" Albus asked in happy surprise. "I always knew Miss Black was quite powerful but… is that why you wanted to separate her from the Dark Lord?"
Harry blinked. "Sure, I mean, that and… she's hot."
"I hardly think being attractive should matter in this."
"Maybe not," Harry playfully admitted. "But it helps when we loan her out for sex to our guests."
"Harry," Albus reprimanded.
"Why do you think Jimmy likes coming over so much?"
Albus lightly reminded, "With the charm, I can tell when you're lying."
"Right," Harry agreed. "And Bellatrix is carrying Remus' illegitimate baby."
Albus furrowed his brow in uncertainty. "At least I thought I could."
Harry's eyes were twinkling merrily.
"Do you think perhaps I could speak to Miss Black?" Albus saw Harry's look and added, "I'm willing to swear an oath to protect her from incriminating herself."
"I'm not going to force her or even encourage her," Harry replied. "But I'll ask for you. It's up to her."
"Thank you," Albus said with an approving nod.
Harry saw Albus was already thinking about what to ask Bellatrix and changed the subject. "How'd he die?"
Albus looked up. "Who?"
"Neville."
"That," Albus answered in irritation, "I do not know."
Harry nodded, urging Albus to elaborate.
"The Longbottoms were protected by a Fidelius Charm that was not broken," Albus explained. "I, myself, put up several other monitoring wards and security measures."
"Anything interesting?" Harry asked. He explained, "Wards are something of a hobby of mine."
Albus inclined his head. "Are you familiar with the Greek wizard, Stavros?
Harry let out a low whistle. "Those are some nice wards. Inside or outside the Fidelius?"
"Outside," Albus replied. "I didn't know they could be placed inside."
Harry nodded. "You'll need two separate sets of stones, and the inside ones have to be placed first. Then put up the Fidelius on the outer set, and bring in a second caster unaware of the Fidelius secret. You have to cast them blind because of the Fidelius, but they come out a lot stronger, bound within the secret."
"Interesting," Albus commented imagining how difficult casting Stavros wards blindly would be. "I can tell you according to my monitors Neville never left the property. And after many inspections, I also can tell that he no longer lives within the wards."
"Yeah," Harry nodded. "That points to dead."
"The most damning evidence was his mother's intuition."
Harry blinked having not even considered Neville's parents. " Alice thinks he's dead?"
Albus nodded. "I wonder if perhaps she felt a bond with her son disappear. She was certain he was dead and took her own life a month after Neville's disappearance."
Harry was immediately reminded of the story he'd given Lily Potter and frowned. "That sucks."
"Quite."
Harry doubted the Neville he knew could even imagine leaving his parents with so much grief. "What about Frank?"
Albus smiled. "Were the Longbottoms friends of yours in your world?"
"Naw," Harry replied. "Bellatrix crucioed their brains out when Neville was a baby. But Neville was a friend of mine… 'til he died."
Albus frowned uncertainly. "Sometimes I think you're just messing with me."
"Who? Moi?" Harry meekly said before abandoning the charade. "I could never pull off innocent. Even in the rare times I was innocent."
"Funny," Albus deadpanned. "The charm seems to think you're lying."
"Alright," Harry softly conceded. "Maybe I can pull off innocent."
"Neville," Albus paused. "Neville was a very bright young boy. His situation gave him few social opportunities, but he had a love of learning and books that reminded me of myself."
"Nerd, huh?"
"The Longbottoms had a pond in their backyard covered by the Fidelius and Neville could almost always be found under the shade of a tree reading. He barely ever left the home and wards, but he still carried a Martin Miggs backpack with him everywhere he went. He got tired of having to choose which of his favorite books could fit so he got a hold of his mother's wand and managed to charm his backpack larger on the inside." Albus smiled sadly. "I was so impressed that I offered to charm it featherweight for him."
Harry gave Albus a moment as he saw the old man was lost in memories. "So how did the prophecy get out?"
Albus muffled a displeased grumble. "I was always opposed to it getting out to anyone. Rumors had been spreading and then the papers started reporting unsubstantiated prophecies. Frank explicitly ignored my strongly worded advice and leaked the real prophecy's content and details."
"Doggie got off his leash?" Harry suggested. He gulped at the look on Albus' face and apologized immediately. "Sorry. Continue."
"Frank and I rarely saw eye to eye on what was in Neville's best interests."
Harry was tempted to ask if Albus wanted Neville abused and unloved but held his tongue. "Like what?"
"There should never be a fine line between raising a son and raising a soldier," Albus answered. "And Frank felt Hogwarts would slow Neville down."
"That's like a kick in the balls to you, isn't it?"
Albus smiled. "I think the majority of the lessons at Hogwarts are not learned in the classrooms. Here is where children become young adults, learn to make friends, learn to care, learn to heal, and learn magic. Special students can always be accommodated with advanced tutoring but to view the Hogwarts experience as nothing more than training for-"
"Down boy," Harry interrupted. "I'm with you. Hogwarts, yay."
Albus calmed. He reached for his candy dish and popped one in his mouth. "Yay indeed."
"So what's Frank up to these days?"
Albus pursed his lips on the sour candy in his mouth. "I haven't seen him in six years. He's been trying to run away from his past. I visited him after he'd checked himself into a home for mental healing in Australia. The healer felt I would help Frank confront some of his issues. I don't think he's returned to England in over twenty years."
Harry frowned and wondered if catatonic Frank might have been better off. "So who do you think That Fucker is? Straight answer, please."
"I haven't the foggiest," Albus happily replied. "I spent many years trying to uncover more on the mysterious wizard in black."
"Surely you've got a guess," Harry pleaded.
"I have several guesses, none of which seem remotely probable. And no, I wouldn't care to share them," Albus grinned.
"Why not?"
"Harry, I don't know who he is but I have crossed his path on a couple of occasions," Albus explained. "One time I unwittingly walked right into a trap of his and found myself bound and wandless. He let me go with only minor humiliation, leading me to believe he is not an enemy. And the mystery of his identity has kept Voldemort occupied and confused for decades now."
"You?" Harry repeated doubtfully. "Don't know something and are willing to leave it be? Really?"
"Yes, really. The wizard in black has managed to keep his identity from both myself and Voldemort. And as long as it remains secret, Voldemort will be hesitant and tentative. I have a very good idea of how much worse things could be."
"From what I hear That Fucker avoids confronting Voldemort. Not that he's scared or unable but that he's just being annoying."
Albus smiled widely. "That sounds like vaguely familiar press for a couple of new Lords I know."
Harry realized he'd walked right into that one. "Yeah, but we're pretty."
Albus paused contemplating whether to contend that point before moving on. "I think it's possible that the wizard in black is doing all he can."
"What do you mean?"
"He is remarkably well-informed," Albus replied. "And it is entirely possible that the magic of the Dark Mark prevents people from directly confronting Voldemort."
"You think he's a Death Eater?" Harry asked in surprise while running through all the inner circle names he could remember.
Albus shrugged. "I have several guesses. Some more plausible than others."
"Oh yeah?" Harry questioned. "What's your craziest?"
"I haven't exactly ranked them," Albus replied. "But a number of questions remain about your counterpart's death."
Harry recalled what Bellatrix had revealed. "You think it might be me?"
"I never said that, I said questions remain. I don't know what you've been told, but there was nothing natural about the manner in which Voldemort killed you. Foul, dark magic unlike any I've felt before was involved." Albus shuddered. "It wasn't like any summoning ritual I've read about, but your deaths were not simple murder."
Harry smothered a grin. "You think Voldemort might have summoned a demon That Fucker?"
"You asked for the craziest," Albus replied. "But I get the feeling you know more about that night than I."
Harry looked at Albus before answering, "I suppose unless you're confronted with it, you assume Voldemort's claims of nearing immortality are nothing more than hollow boasting."
Dumbledore blanched and whispered out, "What?"
Harry winced and asked, "Have you ever heard of a… horcrux?"
Albus pursed his lips and searched the recesses of his mind. "I don't think I have."
Harry sensed only truth from the charm and nodded. He almost wished he could take that word back but figured he'd let the Headmaster figure it out on his own. "So that's your craziest?"
Albus considered pushing Harry on the subject but realized Harry wanted him to discover something himself. He would ask Harry more questions when he had the right questions to ask. "Well, I suppose now we should give serious consideration to the possibility of travelers from another world."
"Touché," Harry agreed.
Albus took a moment to choose his words carefully. "May I ask you something personal?"
Harry glanced at his watch. "Yeah, sure. But don't waste your last question on something you know I won't answer. I'm going to get going after this."
"I was hoping to hear in your own words why you aren't more opposed to the Dark Lord Voldemort."
Harry looked up. "Truthfully? I guess it's really that he hasn't done anything to me. I'm like the out-of-towner who just moved to a new country. While I'm not in favor of my neighbor's death, I don't feel any attachment to them. And as different as the worlds are, I can't see the same darkness in similar eyes nor do I receive the same kindness from the familiar faces.
"For me it's simply like everyone are strangers wearing masks of my old friends. If I have to view them that way, then a wizard wearing a mask of the Dark Lord must be held to the same standard. So far this Voldemort took his ass-kicking and has left me alone. My old Headmaster always told me it was the choices we make that define who we are."
Albus grumbled good-naturedly. "That sounds like my usual trite rubbish."
"I would probably try and argue that Sirius and I have already been through a war and deserve a break, but we're both adrenaline junkies who enjoy havoc too much for that excuse to hold water."
"You don't say," Albus dryly agreed.
"But the other main thing is that I absolutely adore the fact that my life in this world has been so relaxing and… normal! I'm just another wizard here. It's beyond refreshing."
Albus blinked in shock. He made sure the brotherhood charm was still in effect. "Well on behalf of this world, we're happy to have you."
"Thank you."
"Now do you mind paying a little rent and vanquishing the Dark Lord?"
"Albus…"
"I'm willing to treat you normal."
Harry felt the charm twitch. "Liar."
Albus was about to clarify when he sensed a warning. He held up a hand stopping Harry from talking just as the current Head Boy burst into the Headmaster's office.
Harry glanced over at the out of breath youngest Potter. "Jimmy?"
Jimmy was gob smacked staring at Harry and the Headmaster in turn. He was panting from sprinting down here and pulled the magical parchment out of his pocket to make sure his eyes weren't playing tricks on him.
Harry saw the Headmaster looking genuinely surprised and did not recognize the Marauder's Map for what it was.
Albus leaned forward and asked, "Mr. Potter? What is so important that you felt the need to burst into my office?"
Jimmy looked at the map and back three more times continuing to ignore the Headmaster. He stared right at Harry, begging for an explanation. "You're Harry… Potter?"
Harry flashed an irritated look at Albus and stood up. "I think that's about as crystal clear as a cue to leave can be."
"No, wait!" Jimmy pleaded. "I just… I mean… huh?"
"Do not pass on this golden opportunity," Albus warned Harry. "And I hope to speak to you again soon, Harry."
Harry glanced at his hand and then the Headmaster. "Feel like leaving the charm up?"
"Delighted to," Albus agreed.
Harry slung an arm over the confused and wary Head Boy's shoulder. "Tell me, Jimmy, have you ever played the obliviate game?"
"Harry!" Albus scolded.
"Good point," Harry nodded firmly. "Let's get you away from these pesky over-protective Hogwarts wards."
Jimmy looked to the Headmaster before turning to Harry and shrugging. "Okay."
"James?" Albus warily inquired.
"As Head Boy I can leave the grounds," Jimmy claimed. "Besides, he's my brother. What's he gonna do?"
"Yes Albus," Harry parroted. "What am I going to do?"
Albus slumped back in his chair in tired acceptance of the situation. "Good night, children," he pouted with emphasis on the last word.
"Refresh my memory," Jimmy said beginning the walk down the spiral staircase. "I think I've played the obliviate game before but I'm kind of fuzzy on the rules."
Albus really hoped Jimmy was kidding.
