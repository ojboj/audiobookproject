  CHAPTER SIX 
"Now's your last chance to do the smart thing," Harry said taking a closer look at the wards in front of them.
"I'm insulted you even have to ask."
"Sorry Padfoot," Harry said patting the man on the back. "I should know better than to accuse you of being smart."
"Your mum and Moony used to try the same stuff, but I never gave in to their peer pressure."
Harry grinned at his godfather. "I see three different sets of wards. Any ideas on how you want to get around them?"
"Killing Curse?"
Harry turned towards Sirius scratching his head. "Let's try this again. Any ideas on how we can get past the wards without setting them off?"
"Alright fine," Sirius grumbled and cast a spell over his eyes. "The first ward is line-based and it appears to be… muggle-repelling and a wizard detection, right?"
Harry was impressed and it showed on his face.
"I know a thing or two," Sirius said pretending to be offended. "I wouldn't have suggested this if I didn't think we might pull it off."
"I'm just surprised you even know the difference between a line-based ward and an area ward."
"I've cast a few different area wards over the Slytherin table and hallway in my day," Sirius explained while experimenting on the ward. "I'm stronger than Moony, and Prongs has always been a bit… accident prone. That's why back in the day, the bigger wards were almost all my work."
"And Wormtail?"
"Wormtail," Sirius bit the inside of his cheek. "He used to be a good lookout. Ah-ha! That's it. You took your potion?"
Harry nodded.
Sirius focused on a simple fuzzy tennis ball and transfigured Harry, and all the things on his person, into the singular small inanimate object. With a pop he transformed into a large black dog. He picked up the tennis ball in his mouth and calmly walked across the first ward set protecting the Potters' home.
He set the tennis ball down and with a pop transformed back into the healthy adult wizard. He sent the transfiguration reversal at the tennis ball, revealing a surprised Harry.
"I was conscious through that," Harry exclaimed in surprise.
"Yeah," Sirius nodded. "Have you never used a Norton's Brew?"
Harry shook his head.
"Oh they're great," Sirius explained. "I'm sure you know most of the common effects, but essentially it just makes your body far more receptive to magic. Spells cast on you are far more effective, especially if you're helping them along."
"All spells?"
Sirius shrugged. "Just about. So be careful, pain spells are all magnified. With the boosted effect on you from the Norton's, as long as I'm casting it and I want you to keep your mind, if you're fully accepting the spell, then it leaves you conscious. We've used that for spying before, but you can't stay that way for too long."
"So to get past the barrier ward, you turned me into an inanimate object and you into a dog. Neither effected by muggle repelling, nor detected as a wizard," Harry said, looking at the ward they had passed through. "You're not too bad at this."
"Why don't you start pulling your weight and get us through the second one?"
"Fair enough," Harry grinned, stepping up to inspect the ward. It was much thicker than the first and Harry could see it was a compound ward. "Here goes nothing."
Harry located the anchor stone and sent a feedback loop into two different parts of the ward. The visible domes of magic expanded and brightened.
Sirius took a step back as everything brightened. "Did you just strengthen those?"
"Yeah, I suppose I did, but this set is a compound ward. I was trying to separate the parts so we could identify them all and deal with them in smaller groups."
"Go Harry," Sirius grinned. "I think you know more about wards than I do."
"Area wards for apparition and portkey," Harry announced. "It's possible we're keyed considering our counterparts but for now we're just going to ignore those. It's this barrier ward for dark magic that may be a problem." Harry dropped to a knee and took a deep breath. "In case, I get dizzy."
Harry sent a spell down a magical arm and into the anchor stone. A large dark purple box flared brightly revealing the walls went dozens of feet up capped by a ceiling at the top, but only a couple feet into the ground.
Harry stood up and let out his breath. "Lovely. I bet it's for keeping out Death Eaters, but a lot of times my scar will set these types off."
"Considering our intentions any sort of emotional detection could pick up on that too," Sirius mused. "Think we can overpower it enough to jump through?"
"Yeah, but let's not," Harry said. "You see those dark wards in the inner set?"
Sirius nodded.
"Those are goblin wards," Harry explained. "All these others are just defensive and alert-oriented. Goblin wards are completely different, and most of the time very nasty. We're going to need our strength for overpowering those."
"You can't get past them?"
"I don't know, that's the thing," Harry said with a shrug. "We could be able to safely walk past them without ever triggering, or we could walk through them and they choose to kill us in a very messy manner."
"Overpowering that one sounds good to me," Sirius said. "So how do we get past this purple one?"
"It'd definitely detect magic so transfiguring ourselves won't work nor would the doggy side of you," Harry explained. "It's only a little bit into the ground, so how about a ward push?"
Sirius shook his head. "Never heard of it. Sounds good though."
"I'm basically just trying to lift the edge and we'll sneak in under it," Harry said summoning a couple of twigs. He cast a basic barrier ward tying its ends to the sticks. Using a pair of his magical arms, he was pushing his makeshift barrier ward up against the large purple walls.
Sirius watched as it slowly rose out of the ground until the two sticks finally got directly underneath the wall.
Harry was sweating and pulling up the edge of the thick ward set. It was arching around the edges of his barrier, straining against the invading ward. "There," Harry whispered in between breaths. "That's as high as I'm going to push it. You've got to stay low."
Sirius dropped to his knees and saw he'd still need to crouch to get under it. He turned back at Harry before crawling, "Are you gonna be okay?"
Harry nodded. "It's not magically tiring, just physically. Go."
Sirius hurried and crawled through. He stood up on the other side, looking through the translucent purple wall. He watched as Harry dropped to his knees and proceeded to crawl underneath while the ward set appeared to be getting heavier. Sirius grabbed a hold of his godson's arm and pulled him through and to his feet.
Harry accepted the help and let his simple barrier ward collapse, the two twigs falling to the ground lifelessly as the purple box flared angrily snapping back into position. "Thanks."
"When did you get so good at wards?"
"Horcrux hunting," Harry explained as they walked towards the final inner set of wards bearing all the brown murky signs of goblin magic. "Voldemort put a fair amount of effort into protecting his little toys with lots of devious and dangerous traps. Hermione and I both were quick learners out of necessity."
"You hunted for his toys?"
"By toys, I was referring to the pieces of his soul that he'd split off, and whose continued existence meant for all intents and purposes he was immortal."
"Oh… those toys."
"Yup," Harry said. "Have you ever tried to flood a goblin ward?"
Sirius shook his head.
"Me neither," Harry admitted. "And something tells me, it's going to be pretty tiring. Did you pack some pepper-up?"
"I got one," Sirius said. "You going to need it?"
Harry shook his head. "I brought four of them."
"Four! That'd kill you."
"Probably, yeah. I took three doses once over the course of about an hour and a half. Woke up eight days later with a muggle catheter in me. Madame Pomfrey was trying to discourage me from getting hurt so frequently. Needless to say, I'll never do that again. I brought two doses for each of us, in case you forgot."
Sirius checked his watch. "Twenty minutes. Forty left. How are we going to overpower this one?"
"You know how to share your power with me?"
Sirius nodded. "You've got the Norton's Brew in you though, so you gotta be careful you don't drain me completely dry. With the Norton's, you'll be able to sap unconsciously."
Harry nodded and connected with the nearest goblin keystone. "Anytime."
Sirius cast a pooling spell and felt Harry start to drain magic from him.
Harry was feeding as much as he could smoothly straight into the keystone. The wards were sharpening in focus and flashing white. "Alright, it's starting to flood it. We need to jump through during one of the white flashes. It may… feel funny."
Sirius nodded and saw the flashes were steadily increasing and lasting longer each time the white appeared. He glanced over at Harry and received a nod in return.
The very next flash, Sirius lunged forward and hopped through the visible white energy barrier. His senses all flared and it felt as if he were being electrocuted for a split second.
Harry jumped through on the very next flash.
Slowly Sirius felt his magic replenishing as Harry stopped drawing from him. He let the pooling spell dissipate and drank the pepper-up he'd brought with him.
Harry downed a vial after seeing Sirius drink his. "You alright?"
Sirius nodded. "That wasn't too bad."
Harry's attention was drawn to the left side of the modest-sized cottage. "What's that?"
Sirius shook his head. "No idea, but whatever's in there is warded pretty tightly."
Harry glanced back at the manor and then the glowing warded and obscured area. "Want to peek?"
Sirius nodded and began to hike towards the wards at the edge of the woods. As he got closer he saw brown intermixed with yellow wards. "Those look like goblin wards from here."
"Yup," Harry agreed. "Looks like it's got some newer strengthening charms that get regular maintenance."
"We going to overpower this one too?"
Harry shook his head. "We just need past the obscuring field so we can see what's in there. We don't have to actually cross the rest of the wards."
Harry located the anchor and felt his way around it, identifying the obscuring spell. He looped the connection back into itself and the obscured area darkened and shrunk slightly. "Whoops, wrong way."
Sirius just watched Harry staring down at the magical anchor stone. Harry flipped the two ends of the loop around and the obscuring ward lightened to a cool grey, expanding outward just a few inches more than the other wards anchored with it.
"Careful you don't cross the other wards, but we can stick our heads through the first ward safely," Harry said before thrusting forward through the grey barrier. "Whoa."
Sirius followed Harry's lead, and just leant his upper body through the ward. "Gulping gargoyles! What the hell happened here?"
Blackened scorched ground that was still steaming surrounded a tree so dead and hollow, it looked like a skeleton. Dry branches snaked upwards, swirling counter-clockwise from the bone white barbed trunk.
Harry was staring at the ground just in front of the tree from which all this death seemed to spread. The wound on the ground was practically screaming ancient magic. Harry turned towards Sirius. "I think I might know what this is."
Sirius shook his head, realizing he'd been entranced just looking at the decaying soil and tree. "What?"
"I think this may be where I died."
Sirius agreed only briefly before indignantly arguing, "Why's it gotta be where you died? Why couldn't it be like this because this is where I died?"
Harry leaned back away from the ward and patted Sirius on the top of the head. "I suppose anything's possible."
"You were a baby and apparently not the one in the prophecy," Sirius argued, sticking his head back in the ward to look at the small piece of desolation. "This is obviously the death of a far more promising and powerful young man, who fought back valiantly."
"Oh really? No ancient archways of death you could've tripped and fallen into around here?"
"You'd better hope not," Sirius joked back. "You've tripped and fallen into just as many."
"Seen enough?" Harry asked pointing towards the warded area.
Sirius nodded. "Yeah. Let's get my wand and out of here before they get back."
Harry removed the loop from the anchor stone and the obscuring ward darkened and shrunk down to its normal size. He grabbed a twig off the ground and hurried after Sirius.
Sirius figured the front door might be protected from an unlocking charm, but doubted they'd bothered to ward the window. A whispered alohomora and Sirius was hopping through the frame and into the darkened living room.
"Sirius!" Harry whispered forcefully. "At least disillusion yourself in case there are portraits."
"Good point," Sirius agreed and tapped the top of his head, casting the spell. "If things are like I remember, then the only wizarding portrait is an old Great Uncle in the dining room, who watches the floo and delivers messages."
Harry had already disillusioned himself as he too climbed up into the living room. "Where are we going?"
"There's a safe in the floor of James' study," Sirius said as he crept towards the stairs.
"Wut choo doin' here, boy?" A frightened little female house elf squeaked loudly.
"Crap," Sirius blurted out immediately.
"How'd choo get in here?" The elf demanded, shaking her little finger and holding herself with a bit more confidence.
Harry knew the elf could pop out of the way of any spell it saw coming. Knowing the easy solution, he snaked an invisible arm around behind the elf, stunning her before she even took notice of the magic in the air.
"Sirius? How many house elves do they have?"
"Just the one," Sirius weakly answered. "Suppose I should have mentioned her earlier."
"That would've required remembering her before, and that appears to be asking too much."
"Nuts," Sirius said looking at the elf. "I don't suppose you know how to memory charm a house elf."
Harry smirked at Sirius.
"You do know how to memory charm a house elf!"
Harry stunned the elf again for good measure. "It's not that different from memory charming anyone else, but we should keep her stunned for now and obliviate her before we leave. You sure there aren't any other surprises you've neglected to mention?"
"Moony said they bought the elf when Lily was pregnant with James Jr. and Sarah was still in diapers. Forgive me for not remembering an elf I'd never met."
Harry followed quickly behind the disillusioned form of his godfather. The magical sight spell made him easy to follow and they arrived in the study of James Potter. Harry laid the unconscious house elf onto the couch while Sirius unrolled the rug covering the floor. A large stone square lay flush with the hardwood floors. This was the magical safe.
There was no visible door, nor any handle, knob, or settings at all. Just the Potter Family crest was carved in relief onto the stone.
Harry look at the solid stone block. "You do know I've never seen this before and have no clue how to open it."
Sirius realized he'd been staring at Harry and waiting on him. "Sorry. You can try just sticking your hand on the crest, but you may need a drop of blood."
Harry placed his hand over the crest and pushed down. He knocked on it, and it felt like solid stone. He used his new ash wand with a unicorn hair and pricked his finger, letting a couple drops fall onto the shield in the Potter crest.
Harry saw nothing happening and looked up at Sirius. "Did I just cut myself for no reason?"
Sirius sighed. "Muggleborns." Sirius raised a hand before Harry could retort. "I know. You're not. But you might as well be. Try putting your hand on it now."
Harry placed his hand over the crest and looked back at his godfather. "Great. Now I'm getting blood all over my hand."
Sirius was looking at magical safe accusingly. "That should have opened it."
"Well it didn't."
"Have you even asked it to open?"
A soft rustle of air blew out as the stone surface dissolved revealing a compartment far larger than possible without magic.
"Oh," Harry said in lieu of an apology.
"Merlin there's a lot of crap in here," Sirius said peering into the safe.
"Accio wand," Harry incanted. A twelve inch driftwood wand came zooming out from the underneath a couple old tapestries.
Sirius lunged forward and grabbed the wand he'd missed so much. Just like the time he first purchased it at Ollivander's, silver sparks and a black mist slowly emitted out from the driftwood wand tip. "That's the stuff."
Harry was looking at Sirius' wand closely and began to transfigure the stick he'd brought with him. He lightened the wood tone, shaped it to resemble the wand, and coated it with a thin layer of lacquer. "Think this'll pass for it?"
Sirius held his wand up next to it. "Nice work."
"We don't want to advertise the fact that anything is missing," Harry explained as he began to push the fake replacement wand further down into the safe. He repositioned the tapestries to cover up the duplicate. "Shall we go?"
Sirius nodded when he saw Harry frowning at him. "What?"
"How do we close the safe?"
"Same way you open it." Sirius answered without pause.
Harry scrunched his face in concentration. He exhaled tiredly. "I'm asking it to close. I'm ordering it to close. I'm willing it to close. It's not closing."
Sirius frowned. "Maybe you need to bleed on it again."
"Bleed on what exactly?"
"Oh," Sirius said looking into the lidless block turned magical safe.
Harry just stared at Sirius silently. After ten quiet seconds Harry suggested, "Maybe it's just a time delayed thing and it'll close on its own."
Sirius stood there silently for a moment waiting on a bright idea to strike or for the safe to miraculously close. When it seemed neither was going to happen, he said, "I'm sure that's it. Just needs time."
The pair of them stared at the safe for another minute in silence.
"You're sure you-"
"I'm still ordering it to close right now."
Sirius glanced at his watch. "We're already going to be pushing it time-wise." He swished around his new wand and directed it at the rolled up rug. The rug unfurled and covered up the still wide open magical safe. "Why don't you obliviate the elf. We've got to work our way back through the wards."
"I was thinking about that," Harry said moving over towards the unconscious house elf. "Most homes don't have any restrictions on the outgoing floo, only on the incoming. I say we sneak past the portrait and just floo somewhere public."
Sirius was getting a headache keeping this magical sight spell on. He just nodded, looking forward to canceling the disillusionment and oculamagi spell. "Works for me."
Harry left the elf with the memories it expected to have this evening. Only that it had done some work and that there were no visitors.
The two Lord Blacks, disillusioned and silenced, crept into the dining room and saw the portrait was audibly snoring. Harry cast a slight obscuration charm in front of the portrait to keep it from waking up and spotting any flashes from the fireplace.
Sirius went first and Harry sent a finishing spell at the obscuration charm, moments before the floo took him as well.
The pair landed disillusioned and covered in soot at the Leaky Cauldron. One pop right after the other and they both had apparated back to Grimmauld Place.
Sirius let out a tired breath and collapsed onto the couch after vanishing the dust from his robes. "That… was fun.""If there is no other business to discuss," Albus said. "I think that shall conclude this evening's meeting. James, Remus, Tonks? Would you mind staying for a moment?" 
All four Potters and both Lupins had not even got up when the other Order members began to trickle out of the meeting hall.
"I wondered if perhaps there was anything more you'd like to share about the Lords Black that you might not have wanted all the other ears to hear."
"Stuffy, arrogant purebloods. What's there to say?" James snidely remarked.
"Their politics could work to our advantage," Albus explained. "Since they carry the title of Lord they can reassign their representatives to themselves or others."
"Their politics?" Tonks asked slightly uncomfortable at the idea of political power in those particular hands.
"The Black family has a seat on the Wizengamot and the Hogwarts Board of Governors," Albus explained. "The other thing I didn't want to bother too many people with was a curious meeting with Mr. Ollivander."
James suddenly jumped to his feet in surprise. He turned towards Albus and frowned. "Excuse me, Albus. It appears someone just exited via the floo at our place. Lily, you stay here until I get back."
Albus looked thoughtful. "Would you like my assistance?"
James shook his head. "It's probably just someone got lost and left right away."
"We'll go with you," Remus said as Tonks stood next to him.
James nodded, mentally choosing to portkey to his bedroom rather than use the floo. "I'm sure it's nothing. Grab on."
Remus and Tonks shared a glance and put their hands on James as he activated his portkey.
"There was no one here when we left," James explained in whispers while immediately checking his bedroom for signs of intrusion. "And the wards never detected anyone breaking in, only that the floo was triggered outbound. Two times in a matter of seconds."
He led the way out of his bedroom creeping through the eerily quiet home. The three of them worked in formation with James in the lead. He was repeatedly casting diagnostic spells that would sense other people even by heat signatures, and was searching for any new magic.
They'd worked their way to the fireplace in the dining room without incident. James looked around and saw absolutely nothing out of the ordinary. He relaxed finally and loosened the grip on his wand. "Whoever it was didn't seem to do anything and are gone now. See if you guys can find anything. I'm going to check out the ward anchors."
Remus nodded solemnly at James and went to check on Peter Potter, the snoozing portrait there in the dining room. He heard James exit out the back door to check out the wards and turned to see his daughter fighting a chuckle.
"I can't believe those buggers would do this," Remus cursed. "And stop finding this funny."
"What do you think they did?" Tonks asked amusement clear in her expression.
"I've no idea. That couch leech is childish enough to go to a lot of effort for some elaborate prank, but even he should know better than break into the bloody Assistant Director's home with a bloody Dark Lord on the loose," Remus snapped. "James and Lily are going to be worried sick for no good reason."
"Well let's allay their worries then," Tonks said, mocking her adoptive father. She knew she was keyed in and grabbed a handful of floo powder. She chucked it in, and said, "Lupin's Loft." As the floo began to activate she let herself get just barely sucked in and apparated right back to the Potters' dining room.
A split second later, another pop sounded James' sudden arrival.
"Did you just…?"
Tonks raised her hand. "That was me, playing with it. Considering nothing seems damaged, missing, or cursed I'm guessing you might have a loose connection or maybe a couple of the Mikes are doing some maintenance on the floo system close enough to trigger your sensors. If I were you, I'd think about changing your address in the off-chance it was bad guys testing your wards. Sounds like they held up though, right?"
"The wards are all up and functioning. They look to be as strong as they've ever been in decades." James nodded in agreement. "Yeah, you're probably right. I'll go get Lily and the kids. Let them know it was a false alarm."
James activated his portkey to the Order headquarters leaving the two Lupins alone again.
"That was well done," Remus said smiling at his daughter.
"I was raised a Marauder," Tonks said with her chin held high. "You always must be ready to lie and cover for your mates, even if it means pretending to have testicular cancer."
Remus had not heard this one and raised a curious eyebrow.
"Some people will believe anything you tell them about a metamorphmagus."
James Jr., followed by his mother and then father all came exiting out the floo.
"Hiya Uncle Moony," James Jr. greeted just as the grandfather clock in the living room chimed the hour. "Oh crap. I gotta hurry." He ran up the stairs towards his bedroom while both of his parents chuckled at his antics.
"Thanks guys," Lily said squeezing Tonks' hand. "Have you eaten? There should be a few slices of cobbler left."
"Peach?" Tonks asked hopefully.
"Blackberry."
"Ooh," Tonks exhaled happily. "Even better."
Remus grinned. "Well, if you're twisting my arm."
"Nappy!" Lily firmly called out.
With a pop, the Potter family house elf appeared. "Yes'm, Miss Lily?"
"Nappy!" James blurted out having forgotten about her.
"Massa?" Nappy said turning towards James.
"Did you see anyone tonight? Or hear them?" James inquired having completely overlooked the sentient being that had been at home.
"No sir," Nappy said shaking her head. "Iza jus' been doin' my cleanin', Massa. I din't hear nuffin'."
James felt a little more secure already. "No one in the dining room or using the floo?"
"No sir," Nappy assured him with smile. She was rubbing her chin in thought. "But Iza been a singin' and a hummin' while Iza workin'. Miss Lily said I could do dat."
"You have such a beautiful singing voice, Nappy," Lily assured the diminutive creature. She recalled the reason she'd first summoned the elf. "I just wanted to make sure we had some cobbler left."
"Blackberry, yes'm. Would choo like me to get choo fo' slices?"
"No thank you, Nappy," Lily said with a smile. "We'll help ourselves."
"Iza gonna clean out the fireplace now then," Nappy said waddling her way over towards the hearth.
The group of four thanked the small elf and went to the kitchen for some dessert. Remus was at the rear of the group and saw Nappy had grabbed her little house-elf sized mop and was pushing it back and forth, singing quietly to herself.
"Day after day, workin' fo' Massa, Massa gonna sell me 'less I start workin' fassa, oh day after day, workin' fo' Massa…" her little voice trailed off as Remus entered the kitchen thinking Nappy was almost as odd as Kreacher.
They finished off the rest of the cobbler and chatted amiably for over half an hour. Remus and Tonks bid them good night and apparated away rather than to dirty the sparkling clean fireplace.
James was thinking about all the paperwork he still had to finish on the two new ancient Lords. He was brought out of his musings when he stepped into the middle of the rug in his study. He and the rug had slowly sunk all the way up to his waist into the Potter magical safe.
"What the hell?""The adrenaline, the excitement, the lightheaded feeling you get when you finally turn off your magical sight spell," Sirius argued in between the last bites of his supper. "Admit it, Harry. That was fun." 
Harry couldn't have stopped the smile from splitting across his face. "Maybe a little."
"A little schmittle," Sirius waved off Harry's understatement. "You know more than me about that stuff, but we make a good team. What say we hit a wizarding bar and pick us up a couple of wenches?"
"Why are you in such a hurry?" Harry argued sitting back patting his full belly after their large meal.
"Unless someone already has their eye on something," Sirius said before turning to look around the various tables in Diego's. He turned back towards his godson.
Harry nodded over Sirius' left shoulder. "Dark hair over there I've caught staring this way twice already. Not sure about the ogre she's with."
Sirius glanced over his shoulder and had to stifle a snort. The ogre in question just caught the raven-haired woman smiling at Harry and grabbed her to get up and leave.
"Damn," Harry said softly as the attractive woman was side-along apparated away.
"Harry, do you really not know who that was?"
Harry shook his head.
"That ogre, as you call him, was Stephen Parkinson, or Baron Parkinson in most circles."
"That was Parkinson?" Harry asked having never met the man in his dimension, and only knew he had been friends with Malfoy. "Blimey. I didn't know Pansy had a hot older sister."
"She may not," Sirius chuckled. "That was Pansy's hot older Mum."
Harry's eyes widened. A devious glimmer appeared in his eyes. "Parkinson's a Death Eater, right?"
Sirius shrugged. "Don't know for sure, but he definitely associates with the type. Was he one in our old dimension?"
Harry noticed Sirius had readily accepted this as their new dimension, not a new dimension. "To be honest… I don't know. Never met him, but I'd always pretty much assumed." Harry was obviously deep in thought as his eyes kept twinkling despite the dangerous smile on his face.
"Alright, what's that look mean?"
Harry acted completely innocent. "What look?"
"That look," Sirius insisted pointing at Harry. "The one that says you're up to something."
Harry shrugged nonchalantly. "I was just thinking about how we've got to pay that 134 galleon overdue notice before they'll reconnect our floo. And then I was thinking about tonight. You're right. We do make a good team. And it was definitely fun."
Sirius narrowed his eyes. "What are you up to?"
Harry glanced around the restaurant ensuring no one was paying them either too much or too little attention. "What would you think about maybe doing something like tonight… again?"
Sirius furrowed his brow. "You want to steal from Prongs some more? I know a thing or two about tempting fate and that's just not a particularly bright idea."
Harry shook his head slowly, urging Sirius to catch his meaning. "Not from Prongs."
Sirius took a moment to process what Harry was implying when his eyes widened in hope. "Don't you tease me about this."
"We could use the money."
"Harry, you better not be playing with me."
"We've got a little leeway thanks to our ass-backwards noble status."
"I swear to Merlin, if you're suggesting what I think you are, the answer is yes, yes, a million times yes."
"Not just anyone," Harry insisted determinedly as he leaned forward. "Death Eaters."
Sirius glanced over his shoulder where Parkinson had formerly been. "I love you Harry, I really do."
"I mean once we've confirmed they are in fact Death Eaters," Harry rationalized aloud. "It's kinda like we'd be doing a public service, right?"
Sirius couldn't help it and sniffled as he turned away in joy. "Damn bug just flew in my eye."
